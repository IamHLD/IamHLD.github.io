        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My journey into technology began in the 5th grade when I discovered Scratch. What started as making simple movies eventually led to me programming my own aim-trainer game, which was my first real introduction to the power of code.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today, as a first-year IT student at ADA University, I am embracing the challenges of professional development. While I am currently mastering Jekyll and CSS, I have learned the importance of persistence (and regular backups!) after rebuilding my portfolio from the ground up.(twice 😅)</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of my academic life, I am an avid reader and a puzzle enthusiast. I primarily enjoy detective novels, though I occasionally dive into thrillers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also have a long-standing passion for speed-cubing and logic puzzles. In my peak, I could solve a Rubik's Cube in roughly 35-40 seconds. While I don't compete as much now, that same love for problem-solving is what drew me toward coding and IT.</p>
