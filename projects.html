            <h2>Project 1: How does hardware work?</h2>
            <p>In this engineering project, my team and I constructed the three fundamental building blocks of computing: NOT, AND, and OR logic gates. Using NPN transistors, resistors, and breadboards, we demonstrated how physical electrical currents can represent logical operations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This project required precise circuit wiring and a deep understanding of hardware schematics. It was a rewarding experience that taught me the importance of engineering discipline, teamwork, and technical troubleshooting—especially when dealing with sensitive electronic components.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: Web Development Basics</h2>
            <p>For this project, I built the professional website you are currently viewing. The goal was to create a digital home for my work while learning the fundamentals of modern web development and version control.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>What I did to finish it:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Setup:</b> I configured Git and GitHub to track my progress and keep a history of my changes.</li>
                <li><b>Development:</b> I used VS Code to write the HTML and CSS, following a modular design with separate boxes for each section.</li>
                <li><b>Jekyll:</b> I used the Jekyll framework to make the site easier to manage and organize.</li>
                <li><b>Hosting:</b> I deployed the site using GitHub Pages, making it accessible to anyone on the web.</li>
                <li><b>AI:</b> I used AI tools to assist in debugging and optimizing my code.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>This project helped me move from basic Scratch logic to building a real-world application used by developers today.</p>
